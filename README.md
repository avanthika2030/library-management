The Library Management System is designed to efficiently manage books and customer records within a library. The system provides user authentication, allowing new users to register and existing users to log in securely. Once logged in, users can navigate through the main menu, which offers options for managing books and customer details. The book management module enables users to add new books, update existing records (such as book name, number of copies, or publisher), delete books from the system, and display books based on genre, author, or all available records. Similarly, the customer management module allows users to add new customers, update customer details, delete customer records, search for a specific customer using their customer code, and check a customerâ€™s membership status, including its expiry date. The system is backed by a MySQL database, ensuring data is securely stored and easily retrievable. The program also includes various utility functions, such as displaying a welcome message and managing system navigation. Overall, this Library Management System streamlines book and customer record handling, making it a user-friendly and efficient solution for library operations.
